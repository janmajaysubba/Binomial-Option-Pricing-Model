# Binomial-Option-Pricing-Model
This project implements a **Binomial Options Pricing Model** (also known as the **Cox–Ross–Rubinstein model**) in Python to price both **American and European options** with **continuous dividend yields **, including a **Greeks calculator** for Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho.  

Based on the Binomial Options Pricing concepts from *Sheldon Natenberg's* **"Options, Volatility, and Pricing"**.

## Features
- American and European option pricing
- Call and Put support
- Continuous dividend yield (`q`)
- Greeks calculation:
  - Delta
  - Gamma
  - Theta
  - Vega
  - Rho

## Requirements
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage
